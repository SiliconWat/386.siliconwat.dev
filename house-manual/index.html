WHAT TO BRING WITH YOU:

We only provide a generic shampoo and body wash because guest preferences vary so much. If you have a specific preference, please remember to bring yours from home.

We provide a Keurig coffee machine but no K-cup pods because guest preferences vary widely. Please remember to bring your favorites from home!

For instructions on how to operate the coffee machine, please search for “Keurig K-Select” single serve coffee maker on YouTube.

The white security light may be too bright for the person sleeping in the front bedroom. If you’re a light sleeper, remember to bring night shades to blackout your eyes.

The weather in Fresno can suddenly drop to freezing temperatures in the wintertime. Please remember to pack appropriately for the winter months of December through March.

In the summertime from June to September, you may experience a heat wave. Know that plastic materials such as water bottles may melt if kept inside your car. 

FOR LONG-TERM GUESTS:

Inside the kitchen island cabinets, there are extra bowls and plates located on the top shelf. You may need to kneel to see them.

The kitchen sink faucet head can be detached for your convenience. If the kitchen knife is dull, the knife sharpener is clipped to the knife cover.

Please don't take the large trash bin inside from the front porch to use in the kitchen. Too much organic waste will attract insects into the house.

If you need a place to put the dirty towels, the hamper is located to the right of the shower behind the bathroom door. Extra cleaning supplies are also located here for long-term guests.

For long-term guests, when doing your laundry, please wash the bed sheets and pillow cases too. Otherwise, over a long period of time, the stains might become permanent.

Once per week, our gardener will come to blow the leaves and take out the trash from the porch trash bin, usually on Thursdays to coincide with the city's garbage pickup schedule. 

Basic household supplies are provided for the first week of your stay. However, as long-term guests, you are responsible for replenishing them yourselves after they run out.

About once a week, our housekeeper will stop by to pick up all the mail in the mailbox. We have signed up for Informed Delivery by USPS so we will know if we have incoming mail.

If you have outgoing mail you when USPS to deliver, place it inside the mailbox and RAISE the RED FLAG. 

AC UNITS AND SPACE HEATERS:

The AC units and space heaters may be present only during the summer and winter seasons, respectively, to reduce clutter. If you need them nonetheless, please message our property manager.

When all three AC units or all three space heaters are in operation all-day long, our electricity usage surpasses the highest tier. To minimize this high cost and pass on the cost savings to you, we only provide two AC units or two space heaters (one for the living room and one for your bedroom) when there is only one guest stated in your reservation.

If you want to bring more guests, simply update your reservation, and our property manager will stop by with another AC unit or space heater for the second bedroom.

On your way out, if you’re going to be away for most of the day, please turn off all three AC units and all three space heaters. And if no one is staying in the second bedroom, please consider closing that door and turning off that AC unit or space heater therein if provided.

Note: If you’re a long-term tenant and our electricity company sends a letter stating that your energy usage is more than 3 times the baseline, we will deduct the overage from your security deposit per our house rules.

In the summertime, when the AC unit in the living room is set to max, the ambient temperature will bottom out around 25 °C or 80 °F, which is the ideal temperature for most homes. If you shut all the doors in your bedroom and set the AC unit therein to max, your room will get very cold.

In the wintertime, when the space heater in the living room is set to max, the ambient temperature will peak around 20 °C or 70 °F, which is the ideal temperature for most homes. If you shut all the doors in your bedroom and set the space heater therein to max, your room will get very hot.

EXTRA GUESTS AND VISITORS:

Extra roommates and visitors are okay. If they stay the night, it’s just $10 more per guest per night. After you check out, just let us  know the total guests and total nights and we will ask Airbnb to charge your account accordingly.

At least one day before your guests check in, please let us know and our housekeeper will stop by with another space heater or AC unit for the second bedroom if needed.

FOR YOUR INFORMATION:

The porch light is off because it attracts bees. Instead, we have programmed it to randomly switch on and off throughout the night to make the house appear always occupied. The color is red because it deters bees.

To help you see the smartlock keypad at night, we have installed a motion-sensored alternative.

Hence do not open windows or bees might get into the house by following the light.

For your safety, there are two security cameras to capture both sides of the front yard. However, for your privacy, there are no cameras inside the house.

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:

During this pandemic, we notice the news reporting more car snooping throughout the city of Fresno. As a precaution, remember to lock your car doors and do not leave valuables exposed inside your car.

If you need help with any aspect of the house, feel free to reach out to our property manager anytime. Thank you!

CHECK-OUT INSTRUCTIONS:

Please turn off all three space heaters, three AC units, TV, and lights.

Please don’t forget anything valuable because we will not ship it back to you.

Than you in advance!
