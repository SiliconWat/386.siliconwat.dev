`Feel free to make any last-minute changes to the number of guests. 

And anytime during your stay, also feel free to submit an alteration request to extend your stay.

If you cannot submit an alteration request from your end, please message our property manager (using the Airbnb app). He may be able to do so from his end even if your reservation has begun.

FYI: You may want to decide soon because we usually get bookings almost everyday to full capacity.`,
`Look for the ‚ÄúWhite House‚Äù next to the two-story log house.`,
`At night, all the lanterns and lawn lights turn on so just look for the brightest house in the neighborhood!`,
`If available, parking right in front of the house is reserved for you! 

Feel free to park here for your convenience.`,
`Otherwise, street parking is always free and there should be plenty.

ON YOUR SIDE OF THE STREET, CLEANING OCCURS ON WEDNESDAYS USUALLY AROUND 7AM.

If you can‚Äôt wake up early enough, on Tuesday nights, remember to park your car on the opposite side to avoid a citation.
`,
`On the opposite side of the street, cleaning occurs the next day around the same time.

Thus on Wednesday nights, remember to move your car back to your side of the street.`,
`Please walk carefully along the pathway and steps up to the front porch. The main entrance is straight ahead.
`,
`To unlock the smart lock:

Firstly, please give the screen door knob a little PUSH to make sure it is closed tightly.`,
`1. Press the "Wake" button. You should hear a sound and the backlight will turn on.`,
`2. Enter your access code:  1 2 1 2.  Each digit you press should light up and produce a sound.

This one-time code will activate at 4pm on your check-in day, and will expire at 11am on your check-out day.`,
`3. Press the "Unlock" button. You should hear the lock unwind.

If it is reacting but not unlocking, the lock might be stucked. Again, please give the screen door knob a good PUSH to make sure it is closed tightly, then repeat all three steps again.

FYI: After too many failed attempts, the smart lock will freeze. Please wait 5 minutes before trying again. If this still does not work, please message our property manager for help.`,
`Success!  üëç

Please do not slam the screen door.

If the screen door is closed properly, the smart lock will automatically lock itself after 5 minutes.

Of course, you can also lock it manually too by pressing the ‚ÄúWake‚Äù or ‚ÄúLock‚Äù button.

`Depending on the weather, the AC in the living room may be off by default to conserve energy. To turn it on, use the remote taped to the wall next to it.

Each bedroom also has a dedicated window AC unit. You may need to move the bed frame a little to access the controls. 

To quickly cool down your bedroom, consider shutting all the doors in your bedroom and turning on the ceiling fan. Likewise, to quickly cool down the living room, consider turning on the ceiling fans in both the study area and dining area.

Extra pillows and comforters are inside the bedroom closets and hallway cabinets. The futon, bath towels, face towels, and hand towels are also inside the hallway cabinets.

In addition to the power strip, the reading lamp in each bedroom comes with a USB outlet for you to conveniently charge your phone. There is also a nice power strip tower behind the study table to charge your devices.`,
`Depending on the weather, the space heaters may also be off by default to conserve energy. 

PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE SPACE HEATERS FROM THEIR CURRENT OUTLETS to prevent a power failure and fire.

In other words, if you plug any space heater into a different outlet, a POWER FAILURE and possible FIRE will likely occur!

For fire safety, the space heaters may take a few minutes to warm up the entire room. To quickly warm up your bedroom, consider shutting all the doors in your bedroom. Since the living room is a large open space, it may take some time for it to warm up.

FYI: The temperature controls attached to the wall (for the gas heater) do not work.

If there is a power outage, message our property manager and he will come to switch the power back on ASAP.
`,
`The DISH SOAP dispenser is right next to the kitchen sink faucet. Simply PRESS DOWN on it to release the soap. (See red arrow.)

The hand soap dispenser in the bathroom is motion-sensing. Simply put your hand under it to dispense the foam soap.

When cooking pots and pans, please use the provided trivet mats to protect the kitchen countertops from burning. Coasters are also provided in the living room.

For long-term guests, please clean after yourselves on a weekly basis at the very least. The cleaning fee is for standard cleaning only after you checkout and does not condone you to not do any cleaning at all during your long stay. Extra cleaning supplies are behind the bathroom door next to the hamper.

The door in the kitchen leads to the laundry room but it is not suitable for guests because it‚Äôs cramped with household and cleaning supplies and tools. There are many laundromats nearby. We recommend Dirty Bird just down the street. They offer free drying and pickup.

For more helpful tips, our ‚ÄúHouse Manual‚Äù is also located in your Trips itinerary under "Show Details". Please take a moment to read through it carefully for the best experience of our home, especially if you‚Äôre long-term guests.`,
`Please do not take delivered packages inside. This neighborhood is safe, so please just leave them outside on the front porch. Our property manager will pick them up as soon as he is notified by the deliverer. 

Also, when the indoor trash bins are full, please empty them into the outdoor trash bin on the front porch. This way, the smell will not attract insects into the house. Extra plastic trash bags are under the kitchen sink. When the outdoor trash bin is full, please message our property manager and he or his housekeeper will come over to empty it.

The white security light is installed for added safety. But if it is too bright for whomever sleeps in the front bedroom, just message our property manager and he will disable it.`,
`Again, the backyard behind the wooden gate is being renovated and OUR PROPERTY MANAGER RESIDES IN THE GUEST HOUSE (back unit) so that the property is never completely vacant for your safety and to better assist you. 

Also, you may see a Treehouse in the backyard because it is currently being constructed for future guests.
`,
`Lastly, please remind yourself (and your group) of our House Rules which were written with respect for our cleaner, our neighbors, and our future guests. Again, absolutely:

- NO PETS of any kind 
- NO SMOKING of any kind 
- NO PARTIES or unaccounted guests
- No shoes indoors (please do not take our slippers)
- Check out by 11am

If you break these rules, know that we will not hesitate to make the appropriate deductions from your cleaning deposit and security deposit per our house rules.

If you must smoke/vape, please do so outside on the front porch, and dispose of the cigarette butts in the ash tray (near the trash bin) to prevent a fire. If we smell smoke inside our home, know that we will still charge a smoking fee per our house rules.`,
`If you have any questions or issues, our property manager is usually close by, so feel free to message him using the Airbnb app for any assistance with anything. 

Again, please message him using the Airbnb app so we have a record for quality insurance. If you call or text, he may not respond as quickly.

Hope you have a pleasant trip!`
